## Generated Structure

## Next Steps

1. Start services: docker-compose up -d
2. Setup models: ./scripts/setup-ollama.sh
3. Access frontend: http://localhost:3000

## IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTE (N8N Encryption)
For production use, you MUST generate a unique, strong key and add it to your local .env file.
If this key is not set, N8N will auto-generate a new one on every clean start, which can cause encrypted credentials (like API keys) to become unreadable.
Add the following line to your .env:
N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY=<YOUR_GENERATED_KEY>
